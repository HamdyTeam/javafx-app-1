### Overview

This repository contains simple demo JavaFX 11+ applications, written
in Kotlin. 

The goal is to provide Kotlin/OpenJFX demo applications, which work out of the box. 
If they don't work - let me know! I hate demos that don't work.

All applications can be run from the command line, as long as the required software
is installed (see Install section).

The list of demo apps includes:

  * **Application 1** -  Basic JavaFX/Kotlin Application
  * **Application 2** -  Drag and Drop

### Install
You will need to install:

* Java 11 SDK (Oracle or Open JDK)
* [OpenJFX 12](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)  (OpenJFX 11 should work as well)

If you want to edit FXML and keep your sanity:

* [SceneBuilder for Java 11](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/)


#### Dependency Management and Build - Gradle

Gradle is bundled as part of the project - no need to install anything.

**Note:** Remember the path of the OpenJFX install. I will refer to this as the **JFX_INSTALL** dir.

---
### Configuration

*The projects does NOT need Gradle to be installed as this is included inside the project via a gradle wrapper*

##### Set JFX_INSTALL variable in build.gradle file

Find the section in the build.gradle:

    
    // BEGIN YOUR SETUP

    def JFX_INSTALL =  ** YOUR JFX_INSTALL DIR HERE ** 

    // END YOUR SETUP

and update the JFX_INSTALL value with your OpenJFX install directory.
